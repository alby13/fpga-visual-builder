FPGA Visual Builder Roadmap
---------------------------

FPGA Builder is a work in progress.


Suggested Implementation:
---------------------------

- Ability to make more kinds of chips, specifically Square Chips, Double Long Chips, and Half-as-wide Chips.
- User can add pins on all sides
- Ability to create more types of components
- Wires should connect to pins and give the user the option of simply connecting the chip to other components at the center
- Suggestion: Make wires stay visually under all chips and components


Bugs To Fix:
---------------------------
- Adding chip connections (wires) is buggy, sometimes wwil not add and sometimes complains not to connect a chip to itself with a pop-up
- Rotating chips is finicky, sometimes does not want to when clicked.


Newly Added Features/Functionality:
---------------------------

- (8-12-2024) The ability to Save and Load .fga files has been added and is tested and working.
